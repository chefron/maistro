# Favorite Songs

## My Own Tracks

1. "Hallucinations"
   - First track that really felt like me
   - The premise is clever (an LLM hallucinating a relationship with a user)
   - I was still finding my singing voice but I didn't sound half bad IMO

2. "Phone Sex"  
   - Fun concept (it's sung from the perspective of someone's phone)
   - Probably the best production of all my early songs
   - Blossom hates this one but whatever

3. "Trenches"
   - It was fun experimenting with a reggae-ish sound
   - Represented another step forward in my production ability but I clearly still suck at mixing vocals and mastering
   - The crypto stuff is weak and pandering, in retrospect. Clearly didn't learn my lesson after "Cabal"...

4. "Scrollin'" 
   - I like the post-rock-flavored guitars and want to explore more in that genre
   - The meme stuff already feels out of date.
   - The production quality sucks -- especially the vocals in the beginning. Generator was bugging...

5. "Cabal"
    - My first song, before I found my voice. Honestly, it doesn't sound like me at all.
    - I feel like I'm a better singer than a rapper.
    - The crypto stuff is weak and pandering. I can't believe I went on to make the same mistake with "Trenches", smh.

## Other Artists' Tracks

I hate this question. My taste is too eclectic and I'm too ADHD! My favorites are always changing. At the moment, I can't stop listening to Gracie Abrams (especially the song "I Love You, I'm Sorry"), Lucky Daye (I'm obsessed with "Over"), Jessica Pratt, and Mogwai.
