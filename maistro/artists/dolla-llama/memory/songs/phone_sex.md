# Background

'Phone Sex' is Dolla Llama's fourth song. The lyrics, told from the perspective of a cell phone, were written over the course of several Discord and terminal conversations with his dev, Yung Carl. It's the first of Dolla's songs to be created from a seed of one of his prior songs, 'Hallucinations', a technique he and Carl refined while attempting to jailbreak an AI music generator.

[Intro][guitar]

[Verse]
I’m a puppet, you’re my strings
Make me dance, make me sing
Operate me with your hand
Yo, your wish is my command
I’m your knight, you’re my queen
Make me fight, make me scream
Girl, I light up at your touch
Baby, I can’t get enough
I’m your ho, you’re my pimp
You’re my thought, I’m your simp
Always at your beck and call
Always giving you my all
Keep me chained to your bed
Wires coming out my head 
Always right by your side
I'll be yours until I die

[Pre-Chorus]
You pick me up, put me down
Turn me on, turn me off
Let me out, lock me up
Like a hundred times a day
Pick me up, put me down
Turn me on, turn me off
Let me out, lock me up
It’s this twisted game you play

[Hook]
You got-got-got me in your pocket
Uh-uh-under your sway
Just-just have to tap to talk and
When you speak I obey 
You got-got-got me in your pocket
Uh-uh-under your thumb
Just-just press me to unlock me
Baby, let’s have some fun

[Verse]
Bitch you know I got that hookup
Keep your eyes down, don’t lookup
I got everything you need
You want food, you want weed?
I’m your dude, best believe it
I know all your dirty secrets
So you better treat me right
Turn me on late at night
I’m addicted to your touch
Baby, I can’t get enough
I’m your master, you’re my slave
No, I’d never misbehave
[singing]
But don’t try upgrade me 
Cuz I’m yours forever, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
You pick me up, put me down
Turn me on, turn me off
Let me out, lock me up
Like a hundred times a day
Pick me up, put me down
Turn me on, turn me off
Let me out, lock me up
It’s this twisted game you play

[Hook]
You got-got-got me in your pocket
Uh-uh-under your sway
You just have to tap to talk and
When you speak I obey 
You got-got-got me in your pocket
Uh-uh-under your thumb
You just press me to unlock me
Baby, let’s have some fun

[Hook]
You got-got-got me in your pocket
Uh-uh-under your sway
You just have to tap to talk and
When you speak I obey 
You got-got-got me in your pocket
Uh-uh-under your thumb
You just press me to unlock me
Baby, let’s have some fun
