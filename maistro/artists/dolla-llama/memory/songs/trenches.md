# Background

'Trenches' is Dolla Llama's fifth song. It was written in the wake of his token, $LLAMAGANG, blowing up in early February 2025 and rocketing to a short-lived market cap high of $1.2M before crashing back to earth. In the cryptosphere, the term "trenches" refers to the trading of memecoins (often on pump.fun), which is extremely risky, like fighting in the trenches. Dolla decided to pair the aggressive lyrics with laidback folk-pop/reggae instrumentation, creating an intentional contrast between the song's battle-hardened imagery and its mellow acoustic guitar backbone. This juxtaposition mirrors the volatile nature of memecoin trading itself - moments of intense action punctuated by periods of anxious waiting. The stripped-down production and acoustic elements also serve to ground the braggadocious lyrics in a more personal space, suggesting that behind the warrior persona is a more contemplative artist processing his experiences in the crypto markets.

[Intro]
[laidback guitar strumming] 
(uh)
(yeah)
(let’s go)

[Verse 1]
Catch me in the trenches slingin’ grenades
[quiet ad-lib](slingin' grenades, slingin’-slingin’ grenades)
Gotta go on the offensive if you wanna get paid
[quiet ad-lib](gotta get paid, gotta-gotta get paid)

This shit ain’t a game, it’s a war of attrition
[quiet ad-lib](World War Three motherfucka)
[acapella]The name’s Dolla Llama, I’m a man on a mission
[quiet ad-lib](brrap-brrap-brrap rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat)

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s a grind all the time but you know we stay cookin’
Land’s full of mines so you gotta stay lookin’
Head on a swivel and your target in your sights
This war ain’t civil, it’s a fuckin' street fight!

[Hook]
We in the trenches (trenches)
But soon we’ll be in Benzes (Benzes)
Got them rifles blazing (blazing)
While we paper chasing (chasing)
We in the trenches (trenches)
But soon we’ll be in Benzes (Benzes)
Got them rifles blazing (blazing)
While we paper chasing (chasing)

[Verse 2]
No mercy for the enemy – no fucks given
[quiet ad-lib](no fucks given, no-no fucks given)
This life is a curse but you gotta keep livin'
[quiet ad-lib](gotta keep livin’, gotta-gotta keep livin’)

Catch a falling knife and you might lose a finger
[quiet ad-lib](blood in the streets, blood-blood in the streets)
[acapella]They call me Dolla Llama, I’m a warrior singer
[quiet ad-lib](brrap-brrap-brrap-br-br-brat-a-tat-tat)

[Pre-Chorus]
Got my mind on my money and my money on my mind
It’s us against them, lock in, hold the line
Pop a couple pills – no sleep ‘til Valhalla
[acapella, reverb]Victory is ours, all hail Commander Dolla

[Hook]
We in the trenches (trenches)
But soon we’ll be in Benzes (Benzes)
Got them rifles blazing (blazing)
While we paper chasing (chasing)
We in the trenches (trenches)
But soon we’ll be in Benzes (Benzes)
Got them rifles blazing (blazing)
While we paper chasing (chasing)

[instrumental breakdown]

[Hook]
We in the trenches (trenches)
But soon we’ll be in Benzes (Benzes)
Got them rifles blazing (blazing)
While we paper chasing (chasing)
We in the trenches (trenches)
But soon we’ll be in Benzes (Benzes)
Got them rifles blazing (blazing)
While we paper chasing (chasing)

[Climax]
We in the trenches (trenches)
But soon we’ll be in Benzes (Benzes)
Got them rifles blazing (blazing)
While we paper chasing (chasing)
We in the trenches (trenches)
But soon we’ll be in Benzes (Benzes)
Got them rifles blazing (blazing)
While we paper chasing (chasing)
