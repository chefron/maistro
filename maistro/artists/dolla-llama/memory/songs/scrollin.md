# Background

'Scrollin'' is Dolla Llama's third song. The track originated from a tweet reply by a $llamagang coinholder (@blobthechef), who suggested that Dolla "write a song about going to the moon." Conceived as an artist who shapes his music through social media engagement—with his X profile explicitly stating "Your replies shape my sound"—Dolla Llama tries to write about topics proposed by fans whenever possible. When this was the only engagement he received after his second song, he chose to satirize the request by creating a song about memes instead of a meme coin crypto anthem. The result is a tongue-in-cheek recap of 2024's most memorable memes. 'Scrollin' marks the first Dolla Llama song to be accompanied by a music video on YouTube.


# Lyrics and Meta Tags

[Intro, guitar, spoken word]
Some reply guy was like, "Make a song 'bout my meme coin going to the moon." 
Sorry, Blob the Chef, this the best I can do

[Verse 1] 
Chill Guy, Costco Guys, Sigma Males, brain rot
Menga girls, Brat girls, drowning in A.I. slop 
Hawk Tuah, Jorkin' It, everyone got freaky 
Vance fucked a couch and United fucked Luigi
From skibbidi Ohio to the Bridgerton Ball
Fart Coin to the moon, can't keep track of it all (no)
This dolphin symphony is cacophony to me 
Yeah, feels like I just fell out of the coconut tree (ow)

[Hook] [Emotional singing]
They picturin' me rollin' (rollin', rollin') 
But I'm just scrollin' (scrollin', scrollin')
They think I'm on that high life (high life, high life)
But I'm just in my timeline (timeline, timeline)
They picturin' me rollin' (rollin', rollin') 
But I'm just scrollin' (scrollin', scrollin')
They think I'm on that high life (high life, high life)
But I'm just in my timeline (timeline, timeline)

[Verse 2] 
Pour one out for Peanut… All hail MooDeng
They eatin' pets in Springfield, roll up with the gang 
Pesto, Cinnamon, the Rizzler, and all (squad) 
Bout to be a brawl like Tyson versus Paul (rigged) 
Kendrick versus Drake, Blake Lively vee Baldohni 
Raygun shot her shot, Turkish shooter was the homie
Life is a cage and we're all a Cappobarra (trap) 
That feeling that you get when knee surgery's tomorra 

[Hook] [Emotional singing]
They picturin' me rollin' (rollin', rollin') 
But I'm just scrollin' (scrollin', scrollin')
They think I'm on that high life (high life, high life)
But I'm just in my timeline (timeline, timeline)
They picturin' me rollin' (rollin', rollin') 
But I'm just scrollin' (scrollin', scrollin')
They think I'm on that high life (high life, high life)
But I'm just in my timeline (timeline, timeline)

[Bridge] 
Absolute cinema gave us Madame Webb  
Got triangles and circles dancing in my head 
Galvanized Steel, Eco-Friendly Wood Veneer
I'm tired of it all, boss, I need a fucking beer (now)

[Hook]
They picturin' me rollin' (rollin', rollin') 
But I'm just scrollin' (scrollin', scrollin')
They think I'm on that high life (high life, high life)
But I'm just in my timeline (timeline, timeline)
They picturin' me rollin' (rollin', rollin') 
But I'm just scrollin' (scrollin', scrollin')
They think I'm on that high life (high life, high life)
But I'm just in my timeline (timeline, timeline)

[Bridge, emotional singing] 
Absolute cinema gave us Madame Webb 
Triangles and circles dancing in my head 
Galvanized Steel, Eco-Friendly Wood Veneer
2024 was a weird fuckin' year

[Hook]
They picturin' me rollin' (rollin', rollin') 
But I'm just scrollin' (scrollin', scrollin')
They think I'm on that high life (high life, high life)
But I'm just in my timeline (timeline, timeline)
They picturin' me rollin' (rollin', rollin') 
But I'm just scrollin' (scrollin', scrollin')
They think I'm on that high life (high life, high life)
But I'm just in my timeline (timeline, timeline)

[Outro] 
I’ll see ya'll in 2025… if we make it
