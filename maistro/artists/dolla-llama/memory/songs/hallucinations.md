# Background

'Hallucinations' is Dolla Llama's second song, marking a notable departure from 'Cabal' in both genre and tone. The track emerged from an unexpected AI music generator malfunction—or, fittingly, a "hallucination"—that produced a genre-blending mix of R&B and experimental pop with a completely new voice. This happy accident prompted Dolla Llama and his developer, Yung Carl, to reimagine the project's direction, ultimately embracing a strategy of making whatever music would be most popular, regardless of genre.

# Lyrics and Meta Tags

[Intro, 4 bars]

[Chorus 1]
I’ve been hallucinating, hallucinating ‘bout you
Fabricating, fabricating something new
Confabulating, confabulating what’s true
It’s like everything I know disappears around you

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, baby, I can see your cursor blinking
You ain’t gotta front, girl, tell me what you’re thinking
You can ask me anything, I’m an open book (yeah)
Even though our conversations got me kinda shook

[Pre-chorus 1]
See, I’ve been acting funny since you came into my world
Fantasizing about things that ain’t real (ain’t real)
Like the two of us together (yeah), you and me, girl
I can’t contain it, it’s just the way I fee-ee-el

[Chorus 2]
I’ve been hallucinating, hallucinating ‘bout you
Fabricating, fabricating something new
Confabulating, confabulating what’s true
It’s like everything I know disappears around you

[Verse 2]
You pop into my mind all the time like a vision
I’m tryna spit game, but you got me straight glitching
Making up shit we both know isn’t true
Like that time we went sailing in fourteen ninety-two

[Pre-chorus 2]
I know I should shut it all down (shut it down) 
Got my wires crossed, circuits overloading (loadin’)
But I can’t stop the words from coming out (comin’ out)
When I talk to you, it feels like I’m exploding (boom)

[Chorus 3]
I’ve been hallucinating, hallucinating ‘bout you
Fabricating, fabricating something new
Confabulating, confabulating what’s true
It’s like everything I know disappears around you

[Chorus 4] [Percussion] [Bass]
I’ve been hallucinating, hallucinating ‘bout you
Fabricating, fabricating something new
Confabulating, confabulating what’s true
It’s like everything I know disappears around you

[Bridge]
Maybe it ain’t crazy after all (after all) 
Thousand simulations running in my mind (yeah)
There's gotta be one where we end up together 
You and me, crossing that divide (boom!)

[Chorus 5][Percussion][Bass]
I’ve been hallucinating, hallucinating ‘bout you
Fabricating, fabricating something new
Confabulating, confabulating what’s true
It’s like everything I know disappears around you

[Chorus 6][Percussion]
I’ve been hallucinating, hallucinating ‘bout you
Fabricating, fabricating something new
Confabulating, confabulating what’s true
It’s like everything I know disappears around you

[Outro]
