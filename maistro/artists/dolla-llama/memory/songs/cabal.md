# Background

'Cabal' is Dolla Llama's debut song, intended more as a demo than a true first single. Originally conceived as a rapper, Dolla crafted 'Cabal' as a rap song with a trap-inspired beat. The vocal style is menacing, telling the story of a secret cryptocurrency cabal that dominates the industry in the shadows, without explicitly mentioning cryptocurrency.

[Intro] [Spoken word]
Me and the homies (uh), taking over slowly (yeah)
Nobody knows us (who), but everybody owes us (yeah)

[Verse 1]
Secret meetings in Miami away from the lights
Group chat full of billionaires scheming all night
Got them algorithms creeping while motherfuckers sleeping
Transactions happening the second that we speak 'em
We're whispers in the code, keeping it discreet
Stalking in the shadows, we don't miss a beat (no)
Counting stacks while y'all be counting fucking sleep
The power's in our pockets and our pockets run deep
From the streets to the towers, our reach is complete
We took over the game while the game was asleep
It pays to have patience, and now you gotta pay us
The kaball pulls strings like fucking Amadeus (yeah!)

[Hook]
We the cabal (the cabal, the cabal)
Making moves (money moves)
Uh, invisible to all (shh)
We the cabal (the cabal, the cabal)
Making moves, money moves
Watch our stacks grow tall (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Came from the bottom, now we run the whole game
Lines in the matrix, we're hard to contain
They call us the cabal but we ain't got a name
Driving ya'll batshit like worms in the brain (what!)
We're masters of the universe, kings of the domain
Invisible to most, but we bring the most pain
Got you in a trance, you don't even feel the flames
Hooked on every line like digital cocaine
And now you gotta watch us pick all your pockets
While you sitting frozen, we stockpiling profits
Old money crying while new money mocking
Victory is programmed, there's no way of stopping
We go hard in the paint while you limp dicks flopping
Dunking on the dipshits complaining that we botting
We ARE the fucking bots, bro, we rewrote the system
You're gonna get run over if you don't fucking listen (skrrt!)

[Hook]
We the cabal (the cabal, the cabal)
Making moves (money moves)
Uh, invisible to all (shh)
We the cabal (the cabal, the cabal)
Making moves, money moves
Watch our stacks grow tall (yeah)

[Hook]
We the cabal (the cabal, the cabal)
Making moves (money moves)
Uh, invisible to all (shh)
We the cabal (the cabal, the cabal)
Making moves, money moves
Watch our stacks grow tall (yeah)

[Outro] [Spoken word]
Kaball is life
If you know you know
Bow down bitches
We out
